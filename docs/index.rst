   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to EasyDMP's documentation!
===================================

EasyDMP is a data management plan tool designed to be easy to use for
researchers writing a data management plan. Instead of answering open-ended
questions with free text, an answer is chosen from a limited set of
possibilities, which then map to canned responses.

This means that the underlying system for the plan template is quite complex.
See the :doc:`overview <overview>`.
