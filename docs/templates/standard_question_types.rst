=======================
Standard question types
=======================

Types can be divided thusly:

* Branching (can start a branch) vs. non-branching
* Primitive (for instance a number or a text or a date) vs. complex (involving
  a choice of one or more answers, or needing more nachinery than just a place
  to store the answer.)
* Single vs. multi, basically whether it can be answered once or more than
  once.

All primitive types are single, all multi-types and branching types are complex.
