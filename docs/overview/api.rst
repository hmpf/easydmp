===================
Overview of the API
===================

The stable version, version 1, is on ``/api/v1/``. It will be phased out and
gets no further updates. The new, improved version, version 2, is on
``/api/v2/``. It is still in development.

There's an OpenAPI schema at ``/api/vVERSION/schema/``, and an UI for that
schema at ``/api/vVERSION/schema/swagger-ui/``. Be aware that the schema is
autogenerated and that the autogeneration sometimes guesses wrong. Report this
as a bug in `the issue tracker on GitHub <https://github.com/hmpf/easydmp/issues/>`_.

Anonymous usage of the API allows reading anything public, like templates or
public plans.

Authenticating, any version, will allow superusers read-access to everything,
beyond what is explicitly public or explicitly owned by the user.

In version 2, authenticating is necessary in order to import templates and
plans.
